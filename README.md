<h1>EduNova - Educational Platform</h1>

## Project Based On: Smart School

## Description
<p>EduNova is a web based platform designed to modernize education by transforming spoken lectures into personalized, up-to-date learning resources. Utilizing advanced voice recognition technology, EduNova ensures that students have immediate access to custom-tailored educational materials directly on our platform, fostering a more engaging and effective learning environment. This innovative approach addresses the critical need for current and individualized educational content, empowering students to excel in their studies. </p>

## Challenge Adressed
<p> In todayâ€™s rapidly evolving educational landscape, a significant challenge persists: the lack of personalized and up-to-date learning materials in schools. Traditional educational resources often fail to cater to the unique needs of each student and do not reflect the latest advancements in knowledge and technology. On top of that teachers spend more than 37% of their work time to prepare for classes.</p>

## Solution 
<p> Our platform revolutionizes access to personalized educational content by transforming lectures into customized resources, available directly on our platform through voice recognition technology. This ensures students receive updated, tailored learning materials, enhancing their educational experience.</p>
